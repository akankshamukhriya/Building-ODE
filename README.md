# Building-ODE-by-Selective-Parameterizarion

We here submit the Data and Code files, necessary to interpret, replicate, and build on the findings reported in the paper titled as "Building Outlier Detection Ensembels by Selective Parameterizations of Heterogeneous Methods".

Two zip files are in this repository, each of Data and Code.

Data File :
The Data.zip file contains eleven benchmark datasets, with the pre-processed versions, as used in the paper. All these files are in form of Comma Separated Values (.csv). 
The benchmark datasets used in the paper are:
ALOI, PenDigits, ANN-Thyroid, SatImage, PageBlocks, OpticalDigits, SpamBase, Waveform, InternetAds, Pima, and Arrhythmia. For some of these we use original versions given in UCI repository, while for others we use some versions given in DAMI repository: https://www.dbs.ifi.lmu.de/research/outlier-evaluation/DAMI/. For all the versions, we present details in the paper, and the same versions are attached here.
